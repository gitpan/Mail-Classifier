=============================
TODO    Mail::Classifier
VERSION 0.11
=============================

CPAN/Module Maintenance

*   Write better test modules for CPAN packaging

*	Add real module version requirements to Makefile.PL

Functionality Enhancements

*   Allow learn/score to take \@array and construct a Mail::Message on
    the fly

Optimization/Efficiency

*   Test speed problems in parse()

*   Benchmark speed with no disk cache vs disk cache just for word_count as
    a default setting for GrahamSpam

*   Experiment with alternative storage mechanisms and formats (array of arrays),
    separate files/tables for each category, etc. in GrahamSpam

*	More experimentally: consider re-writing to use plug-in classes for different types of
	data storage, allowing transparent replacement of memory/flat file/DB storage options.

Utility

*   Write an example program that can be used with procmail to filter
    or tag e-mail

Algorithm Tuning/Benchmarking

*   Test Graham's default cut-offs and biases vs alternatives

*   Test alternative significance cut-offs

*   Test results of higher threshold for n_observations_required (increased
    confidence, reduced size of word_score, but slower to flag new spams...)

*	Test Robinson's (?) enhancements to Graham's algorithm

*	Test bi-grams versus uni-gram tokens.
