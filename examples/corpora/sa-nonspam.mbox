hi all,

I'm looking to get my hands on
either Doom I or II for my PC.
Unfortunately I cannot access 
IDSoftware's site because of
the silly web-filtering system
in place here.

Does anyone know where I can
buy a copy of Doom (which I will
be running on Linux...) online?
Last time I asked in Game they laughed
at me ;]

I would ask to swap for Linux software
but that wouldn't be ethical or legal.
Hence the purchasing question.

Regards,
Shane

there was a copy of Doom 1 that came free with RedHat 5.2 - 
unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the newer CDs.

get the last laugh by going in, and saying that ID soft actually 
released a Linux wrapper for the game. you need to buy the CDs, though, 
then download the free wrapper.

Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening

To all,

I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.

Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
quickly set up a screening for its members.

I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  

One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
to Hobbyists.  

The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
vegetarian.  

I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  

I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.

One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
preserving the educational/institutional market.

Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.

I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
persons to legally view it.

I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.

Sincerely,

J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

duly noted

definately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.

Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.

Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.

I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?

Later

Interesting take...

"But the more I think about it, the more you I realize that having
governments specify software licensing policies is a bad idea."

I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to another.
However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it. The problem is the bulk of
the data is images and most of these image have two directory entries i.e.
there is a hard link to each file. If I copy them using cp -a or my usual
favourite of find .|cpio -pmd other_dir it's going to copy each file twice,
which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this if the
source filesystem wasn't reiserfs :-( Any suggestions ?

How about rsync.

It doesn't only work for remote files.

  | I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk
  | to another.  However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it.
  | The problem is the bulk of the data is images and most of these
  | image have two directory entries i.e. there is a hard link to
  | each file.  If I copy them using cp -a or my usual favourite of

  | if the source filesystem wasn't reiserfs  :-(  Any suggestions ?

 do your (and my) favourite, it'll be Ok:

  1. cpio(1) preserves hard links, i.e., if F1 and F2 are
     hard-linked and both are "copied", then the "copies"
     are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
     (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
     by definition (IMHO)).

  2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
     read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
     this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
     but am not certain.

 if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:

    cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file

 then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
 under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
 smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
 just once (or so I read the source).

cheers!
	-blf-

p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat
    anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
    and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
    isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
    so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
    links.  which it will.

How about something like:

cd {dest.dir}
tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -

tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
the owners too... :)

Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

>From the website:
"Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
as well)"

I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596

Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
resulting graphs are pretty!

Donncha.

 the above (or something close to it) will work.

 however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).

 the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media.

 the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not "saved" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a "large" blocking factor is used.)

cheers!

Eh?!? Oh wait... <pause while original mail is re-read>

Doh. Sorry, I automatically read 'soft' in front of 'links', despite all
evidence to the contrary. I thought the original question was a bit
strange...

On that note: is there any real benefit to using hard links? I avoid them as
a rule, and cannot think of any good reason to use them at the moment.

There are lots of benefits to using hard links, for all sorts of reasons. In
this case, they are being used to provide two quite different namespaces
for the same set of files.

Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Cheers,

	John Gay

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
immediately obvious to everyone.

Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
is automatic.

  |[ ... ]
  |  the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always

 ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-(

 the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links.

 I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-(

 anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb.

 using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ 

sorry.  cheers!

 maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,
 or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines
 that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company!

 there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link.

 I use this fact on occasion to "save" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 "temporary" file does not destroy the data.
 
cheers!

Could anyone who is interested clarify this for me.
Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.

The setup is as follows:
I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
my knowledge, GPL. 

The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
use a different service provider but keep my code. 
Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.

I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.

In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted". Then
periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.

That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever, you still have
a link under ".unwanted"

Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.

Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)

Tell her that the computer is less likely to fail if it's never turned off
so you won't need to be spending money on repairs, and that this offsets the
electricity costs.

This has the advantage of actually being true (well, up to the , anyway) :-)

talked about unrm for nearly ***20*** years - and that's just what i
bothered to look up.  think about it.  in that time bsd has been freed
from at&t and then forked in four different directions, gcc, linux,
mozilla, gnome and kde have been written.  as has almost every bit
of the gnu project - including (sh|file)-utils.  and think about it,
have the gnu (sh|file)-utils developers ever met an option they didn't
implement if they could?  even /bin/true and /bin/false take arguments.

so yeah, unrm would be nice, but obviously it's not a simple problem.
millions of lines of code, hundreds of projects, no unrm.  heck, the
hurd will probably release 1.0 before unrm shows up.

php's license is completely irrelevant to this.  think about it.
solaris releases their system which includes /bin/sh.  their license
is very restrictive and they retain the rights to their whole system.
but they don't own every shell script ever written by solaris admins
around the world.

i doubt it.  and i suspect it would cost more to litigate then you
would get.

mh used them nicely.  mh stores one message per file.  the refile command
allows you to move a message from one folder to another *or* link it to
another folder.  it uses hard links to do this.  this would suck to if
it used soft links - what if i later deleted the actual file?

 Bind configs are one sort of file.

 I think the person asking Kevin the question would like to have a nice
config language like:

 domain: "bing.com"
 hosts:  www mail arse smeg twitter
 ttl:    20000

 and then using lex & yacc, they could write a program that converts
between that config file, and the tedious bind configs, and maybe even
auto-generate a reverse DNS config file while they are at it.

 Personally, I think they are demented. It's much more a job for something
simple like Sed or Awk. People using lex & yacc just because they can make
baby jesus cry.

Howdy all, 

I have a friend with the problem outlined below, suggestions anyone?


"I have a dell inspirion 2650 laptop, with a P4 1.6GHz proc., an Nvidia Geforce II graphics card (8Mb) and am trying  to 
install redhat 7.3 .
The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular 
monitor the screen doesn't default back to the nice clear picture  i have become acustomed to but  remains fuzzy and 
flashy so it is impossible to test another monitor type. rebooting allows me to run in text mode  where i try to configure X 
again with Xconfigurator but i run into the same problem again.

Very annoying..."

Ta very,

 That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as equally
broken, rather than standing up and saying "how about we try & make
everyone better".

 (why ? Because in the real world, you can't. Somethings just suck)

I upgraded from RH 7.2 to RH 7.3 over the weekend and now the network card
has died, when I take a look at the network configuration tool it tells me
the card is inactive and when I try to activate it the operation fails. I
cant seem to find 3C905C software on the web ! Any ideas ?

Cheers
Liam

It's not hard math - jpeg is a straight block-based DCT with
quantisation - which is about the oldest image compression
algorithm out there, and I think certainly predates 1986. So I
really have no idea what they claim they've patented - doin DCT
on 8x8 blocks of an image, quantising the resulting coefficients,
or DCT in general? I'm extremely skeptical about this whole
story...

MPEG 1, 2, 4 or 7? They're all very different compression
algorithms.

Anyway, here's to ogg, and hopefully the future mpeg4-standard
compression algorithm the project comes up with (fingers
crossed). And I wouldn't worry about the jpeg thing - in addition
the patent runs out next year, and I would suggest that having
failed to protect their IP for 15 years, as (iirc) is their
responsibility, their claim would probably never hold up in
court.

Cheers,
Dave.

pah.. MS'd just buy them. (and i'm sure they'd happy for this to

oh yes, see you've setup that tdma thingy, so here's a thought. do
you reckon spammers (or the software they use) is/are smart enough to

	s/\(.\)+\+.*@\([a-zA-Z\.0-9\-]\)/\1@\2/

on email addresses? it's a fairly old trick, so i dont see why they
wouldnt.

personally, i rarely get spam to any of the plussed addresses
i've given out - i think i've only ever gotten /one/ cause ebay 
seem to have sold on my address. apart from that - never, not even 
to +usenet, so i wonder whether harvesting software does the above.

I have a situation with a small network as follows:

A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.

An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.

How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.

I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.

Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.




Niall

Keep an eye on eBay.  One annoyance of eBay is that many sellers state "will
ship to US only".  However, I've found that if you ask nicely, they will
usually ship over here.  For payments, either setup a paypal account or
post the seller a US dollar bank draft.  I've got lots of little bits and
pieces that way (for example, finally got my hands on a rackmount kit for
my DECserver 700 terminal server which I'd been looking for for ages, for
a total of US$15).

Later,
Kenn

 Has anyone used (successfully!) a fat undelete program on Linux ?

 Something like a simple version of the norton disk tools would be fine.
Actually, most likely the MS DOS "undelete" program would do...

I had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap
against. The IPID sequence generation was all zeros. Someone said this was
indicative of earlier kernels but was fixed about 2.4.5 version. Since I'm
running the latest what is causing this? I ran nmap against a 2.2 kernel
using chains and it had better results than the stock 2.4 kernel.

You can't; hard links only. And those get cleaned up by ScanDisk as
"cross-linked files". Shortcuts are the Windows analogue of symlinks,
and they don't work outside the Windows environment - i.e. they're an
artifact of the OS rather than the FS.

You know it's stupid - I know it's stupid. Nonetheless, Microsoft has tried
to spread FUD about the viral nature of the GPL to make CEO/CIO level people
(often not the most technically clueful, even the CIOs) fear that if they so
much as use a Linux box, as, say, a print server, they'll have to make their
company's entire IP public. (I don't think Microsoft said precisely what I
jsut said, but that was the tenor of the remarks). And their marketing
budget is a tad bigger than yours or mine.

No idea if it can do these ones but mxv (or MixViews) has lots of
configurables and it's whole purpose is to edit wavs.  I've used it to
split up tapes into individual songs.  Not sure of a URL but the author is

Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*

Cheers,
Waider.

As far as I can remember, the fact that the IPID is zero was introduced into
2.4 was to introduce correct behaviour, i.e. in the case where it is not
needed, it is set to zero.  This was discussed on bugtraq a while
ago....lemme see...
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/2002/03/msg00372.html shows a
message from nmap's author on the subject.  The only thing having IPID==0
achieves is that you have one more criteria on which to base your OS
fingerprint which isn't really much of a problem to be honest.

Stop worrying about it :)

but that's just stupid.  microsoft s/w covers a subset of applications
that are under the gpl.  there are gpl word processors, there's a
microsoft wp; there are various language compilers and interpreters under
the gpl, microsoft has their visual compilers.  and so on.  and just
like the gpl apps, the microsoft apps are distributed under a license.
that license says lots of things, and there are various licenses used by
microsoft, but in a nutshell they all pretty much say: you can't copy,
distribute or modify their s/w; you can't sell it multiple times.

so does anyone think that applies to their wp documents or their visual
c++ code?

the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.

and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:

    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
    that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
    only a message to that address will work to free the message from
	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).

all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/

I've been playing with an old Dell OptiPlex5110 and decided to attempt to 
build a PentiumMMX optimised Linux on it.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for  compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to 
the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of 
matrixes and can also benifit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, 
I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, 
so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage 
of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even 
more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or 
do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian 
compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries  should be re-built? Can they 
take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? 
And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I 
would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the 
kernel, X and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking 
for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX 
M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another 
I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the 
SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't thing it is worth replacing 
two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch 
the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not 
had much luck.

Cheers,

	John Gay

uh, i wouldn't.  i was referring to the previous message which discussed
the idea of a symlink that referred to a 64 bit device id and the inode
of the file.  i gave two examples of why it wouldn't work.

yes.  i did fail to mention that floyd might not use inode 111, but
it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.

mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).

i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.
