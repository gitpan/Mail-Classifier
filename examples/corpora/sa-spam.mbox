Organization: 


Attention:  Internet Domain Registrant

The new top level domain names with extensions .BIZ, .INFO, .PRO, 
and .NAME have just been approved by global internet authorities 
and will be released soon, but don't wait until then to register.  
These domains are available NOW for pre-registration at:
http://www.RegisterNewExtensions.net on a first come, first serve 
basis.

"While .com names hold the most prestige, the next frontier is
the new suffixes -.info, .biz, and .pro -likely to become available
later this year..."
-BUSINESS WEEK MAGAZINE, April 16, 2001.

It is expected that over 3 million of these new domain names will be
registered in the first few minutes when registration officially opens
later this year. If your domain name is important to you, be prepared 
and pre-register now. Protect your domain name from cybersquatters and 
speculators. We have the premier pre-registration engine to help you 
to secure the domain you want.  Over 250,000 names have already been 
queued into our list and good names are going fast.  Do not wait until 
the last minute.  Go to http://www.RegisterNewExtensions.net now to 
pre-register.

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLY

Simple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,

Ron M. Jenkins
Home-Mailing Division Manager

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

I am a TV producer for one of the three major networks and

special story and thought you might be able to assist.

I AM REALLY LOOKING FOR A GREAT STORY!

Here's the type of story we are seeking;

Are you interested in finding a long lost love from 
your past? 
Your first love? 
The one that got away?
 
If you are, WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE YOUR DREAM COME TRUE!
(if you are not, PLEASE send this to your single friends)
 
To be considered for this rare national TV opportunity, 
you MUST;
1. Be single and available
2. Have a sincere interest to find a former love
3. Be willing to share your story on NATIONAL TV
4. Be able to travel to Los Angeles (We pay for everything)
 
If this is YOU...then here's what you need to do next-

3. Tell us WHY you want to find him/her. (Let your feelings out)
4. Tell us WHERE they were last time you saw them (specifics)
5. Tell us how to reach YOU BY PHONE- HOME, WORK, CELL, email

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

<BR>Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 <BR>over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 <BR>wanting to know some of the most valuable "secrets" 
 <BR>to my on-going internet success.
 <BR>
 <BR>Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 <BR>*true* "secrets" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 <BR>become successful in the online world is not a "secret", 
 <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 <BR>Net or off.
 <BR>
 <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 <BR>consultation, or simply asking, "What's your secret?", 
 <BR>I have to blush & say ...
 <BR>
 <BR>Persistence and personality.
 <BR>
 <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 <BR>
 <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 <BR>It's not years of digging to find the "secrets" to internet riches.
 <BR>
 <BR>One thing that "gets to me" so often in my work as an 
 <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 <BR>their online venture, that "success" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 <BR>
 <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 <BR>
 <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
<BR>the Bank. Get it!! 
 <BR><a href="http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . 
 <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 <BR>online venture a success. 
 <BR>
 <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 <BR>"self marketing" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 <BR>agree with him more.
 <BR>
 <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 <BR>
 <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 <BR>
 <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 <BR>which is the only "real" place it ever was anyhow!
 <BR>
 <BR>Yes, "persistence and personality" inherently includes 
 <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 <BR>
 <BR>That may be the most incredible "secret" we ever 
 <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 <BR>
 <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!

<BR>----------------------------
<BR>Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

<BR>Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
<BR>Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
<BR>Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

 <BR>over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 <BR>wanting to know some of the most valuable "secrets" 
 <BR>to my on-going internet success.
 <BR>
 <BR>Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 <BR>*true* "secrets" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 <BR>become successful in the online world is not a "secret", 
 <BR>in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 <BR>repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 <BR>Net or off.
 <BR>
 <BR>But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 <BR>consultation, or simply asking, "What's your secret?", 
 <BR>I have to blush & say ...
 <BR>
 <BR>Persistence and personality.
 <BR>
 <BR>Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 <BR>disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 <BR>same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 <BR>the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 <BR>my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 <BR>
 <BR>Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 <BR>It's not years of digging to find the "secrets" to internet riches.
 <BR>
 <BR>One thing that "gets to me" so often in my work as an 
 <BR>Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 <BR>Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 <BR>have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 <BR>between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 <BR>almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 <BR>of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 <BR>LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 <BR>their online venture, that "success" is the  <BR>equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 <BR>
 <BR>It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 <BR>
 <BR>Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 <BR>has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
<BR>the Bank. Get it!! 
 <BR><a href="http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb">http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb</a> . 
 <BR>But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 <BR>so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 <BR>online venture a success. 
 <BR>
 <BR>And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 <BR>"self marketing" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 <BR>the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 <BR>agree with him more.
 <BR>
 <BR>Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 <BR>succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 <BR>marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 <BR>experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 <BR>Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 <BR>
 <BR>The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 <BR>standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 <BR>between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 <BR>not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 <BR>to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 <BR>
 <BR>What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 <BR>you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 <BR>When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 <BR>wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 <BR>disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 <BR>which is the only "real" place it ever was anyhow!
 <BR>
 <BR>Yes, "persistence and personality" inherently includes 
 <BR>honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 <BR>qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 <BR>goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 <BR>powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 <BR>
 <BR>That may be the most incredible "secret" we ever 
 <BR>uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 <BR>won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 <BR>
 <BR>Talk about SIMPLE!!

</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>How the Snore Eliminator will help you!</p>
<b>
<p>What Causes Snoring?</p>
</b></font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle</p>
<p>Excessive fat on the throat</p>
<p>Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and</p>
<p>Throat swelling from allergies and food</p>
<p>Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">stopping
of breathing, </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a <b>blocked airway during sleep.</p>
</b>
<p>The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a <b>weakened current of incoming air. </b>This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.</p>
<p>Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who <b>sleep on their
backs</b>; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>The hidden dangers of snoring?</p>
</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated</p>
<p>Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring</p>
<p>Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical condition</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>Snoring decreases sexual performance</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.</p>
<p>Most people who snore have a </font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">shortage
of oxygen</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>How the Snore Eliminator works!</p>
</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">natural
enzymes</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
reduces the noise</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040"> made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the<b> </b></font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">throat
a chance to relax</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.</p>

<p>TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:</p>
</b></font><b><font FACE="Times New Roman" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Lorenzo writes...</p>
<p>I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.</p>
<p>PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.</p>
<p>Alex writes...</p>
<p>My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.</p>
<p>Thank you for a product that has really helped us!</p>
<p>Glen writes...</p>
<p>In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.</p>
<p>Steve writes...</p>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to thank you for your wonderful product and tell
you how much my wife, Tracy, and I appreciate the quiet nights we have enjoyed
since discovering it. It's very rare when a product actually delivers what it
promises but Snore Eliminator truly does. We have tried most of the other
advertised remedies without any satisfaction and I am very pleased to be able to

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.

1. Navigation System

Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.

It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:

- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.

2. Color Scheme

When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.

A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for "color schemer."

3. Content Window

This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.

Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.

To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.

4. Font(s)

Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)

Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.

The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.

5. Advertising

Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as "banner" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.

New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called "skyscraper" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)

Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

    Conclusion

These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email 
address is mailto:corbb@justforwebmasters.com.

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

"Just because we're working online doesn't mean we should forget
to market offline as well.  Heck,some days I get more leads in the 
supermarket than I do online."
-- Henry C.  http://www.fastersurfing.com
~~~~~~~~~

"I attach mailing labels with my message printed on them on the 
back of my business cards, on flyers, brochures or anything that 
I hand out to my customers."
-- Rick A.   http://www.iprocenter.com/rickarmstrong  
~~~~~~~~~

"I promote my business opportunity website both online and 
offline. The printed media is very valuable to promote my presence 
on the internet. Having a website is just like having a "sign-post 
in the desert". Without anyone knowing where to look to find you, 
your website is a museum with no visitors.

         <tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" colspan="2" valign="top"><a name="article1"></a><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" color="#003366"><li><b>5 Ways to Create a Unique Website</b></font></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top">  </td><td bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><p>Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of
<br>identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
<br>have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
<br>These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
<br>design for your website.
<p>1. Navigation System
<p>Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
<br>things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
<br>usually look for a way to get to the information they want
<br>before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
<br>navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase
<br>(<a href="http://www.webmasterbase.com">http://www.webmasterbase.com</a>)
for example. There is a list
<br>of categories on the left, and information about the network
<br>on the top bar.
<p>It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
<br>bottom of the page because:
<p>- People see the top of the page first
<br>- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the
visitor.
<p>2. Color Scheme
<p>When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.
<br>For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.
<br>Some colors that are often used are white on black or black
<br>on white.
<p>A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color
<br>Schemer (<a href="http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/">http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/</a>),
<br>created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that
<br>can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on
<br>FreewareFiles (<a href="http://www.freewarefiles.com">http://www.freewarefiles.com</a>),
Tucows
<br>(<a href="http://www.tucows.com">http://www.tucows.com</a>), or Download.com
<br>(<a href="http://www.download.com">http://www.download.com</a>) for
"color schemer."
<p>3. Content Window
<p>This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text
<br>here is easy to read and understand.
<p>Also, provide your own original content. People do not want
<br>to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear
<br>what <i>you</i> want to say! While it might be time consuming to
<br>write your own content, it sure is worth it.
<p>To find content for your website, try searching at
<br>EzineArticles (<a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com">http://www.ezinearticles.com</a>).
Other people
<br>may have used the articles, but if you become good friends
<br>with the authors, they may send you new content as they
<br>write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content
<br>from other authors, as mentioned above.
<p>4. Font(s)
<p>Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
<br>fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
<br>Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
<p>Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
<br>Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can
<br>be used for long pieces of text.
<p>The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
<br>or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
<br>(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
<br>is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
<br>its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making
<br>it easier to read.
<p>5. Advertising
<p>Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing
<br>that almost every website has. The most common type is
<br>what is known as "banner" advertising. It is called that
<br>because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long
<br>you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
<p>New sizes however are being used. Take for example the
<br>new style called "skyscraper" -- so called for a reason: it
<br>looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not
<br>too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
<p>Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners
<br>used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the
<br>page.&nbsp; Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in
<br>the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.
<p>Conclusion
<p>These are only five things to consider when designing a
<br>website. There are many others however. Let me know
<br>what you find that helps you create a unique website. My

made 13 sales first week'. That's $13000' this 
is the best program I've done and I've done them all! 

Richard S. Memphis, TN 
  
I did it all with my computer! People sign up like crazy! 
First I said, ok, I am financially totally down, I need to 
give this one a try. But after two weeks I am already out of debt! 
Oh god, I did not expect that! And I am not a sales person and I 
did it! I am so excited, thank you Richard and Mary! 

Randy S. Los Angeles, CA 
  
I am SPEECHLESS! With your FREE leads, and FREE 
unsecured Visa MC, I was able to advertise free 
& pay for faxes that got my phone ringing off the 
hook! I think I'll have 20 sales this month!!! 
I haven't even begun to download all the free 
software to make even more MONEY' Thanks guys 

Randy S. Detroit MI 
  
I was in my chiropractor's office when the secretary 
was about to throw out a fax that they had just received. 
The fax was similar to this email and caught my eye. 
I did exactly what it told me to do (a fax blast) and 
in my second day I made $6,000. No hard selling, no 
hustling my friends, just friendly people looking at 
a great opportunity and wanting in. Even if it took 
me a month to make an extra $5,000 I would have been 
happy, but $6,000 in my second day, wow! I'm excited.

This University Degree Program removes the obstacles that cause adults to abandon all hope. 

You may know employers continually hire, promote and reward raises to new employees.  They may have ZERO skills or experience, but they are continually promoted just because they have this piece of paper.

The degree earned by our students enables them to qualify for career advancement and personal growth.  This acclamation also breaks down the walls that prevents you from receiving the more fulfillment and proper compensation. 

With our service, you are provided with an official graded transcript. Duplicate transcripts will be filed in the graduate's permanent record with our colleges. 

Degree verification and official transcripts will be provided in writing when requested by employers and others authorized by the graduate.

Our College and University transcripts meet the highest academic standards. Our University issues a degree printed on a premium diploma paper, bearing the official gold raised college seal.

Your degree is closer than you think.
No one is turned down.

Confidentiality is assured, and we are awaiting your call today!

CALL 1 713 866-6501

Call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including
Sundays and holidays.
