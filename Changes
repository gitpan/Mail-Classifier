Changes to Mail::Classifier            
========================================
Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Classifier.

0.11	Tue Apr 22 06:52:27 EDT 2003

	-	deprecated setparse() and replaced $self->{parsefcn} crud
		with a simple member function "parse" that can be subclassed 
		as needed. This simplified a lot of crud elsewhere.

	-	created a "classify" function to make classification tables
		on an existing, trained Classifier (avoiding destructive
		validation in "crossvalidate")

	-	tore out and replaced save/load functionality from scratch
		to use Storable to a single file rather than dumping it to
		a set of MLDBM files (seems to have improved size/speed of 
		resulting saved files, too)

	-	new save/load subsystem also fixes bugs loading saved Classifier 
		objects (thanks to Brad Davis for finding this bug in the first place)

	-	added a very rudimentary procmail-based spam filter called
		"spamometer" in the examples directory
