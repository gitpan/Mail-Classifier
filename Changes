Changes to Mail::Classifier            
========================================
Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Classifier.

0.12	Tue Feb 24 15:57:21 EST 2004

	-	tag() now tags with reserved category "UNKNOWN" if no category
		meets the probability threshold.  This guarantees that all messages
		passed to tag() will receive a header

	-	parse() augmented with a separate tokenize() function
		parse() now tags 'to', 'from', 'subject', and 'mailer' tokens
		with context

	-	tokenize() extracts href/src/mailto host/addresses, strips
		all html tags, decodes html entities, and does much smarter
		handling of punctuation for words with punctuation 
		embedded within.  Also strips ">>>" forwarding symbols.
	
	-	prediction now uses Robinson-Fisher inverse chi squared to combine
		individual word predictors

	-	deprecated setparse() and replaced $self->{parsefcn} crud
		with a simple member function "parse" that can be subclassed 
		as needed. This simplified a lot of crud elsewhere.

	-	created a "classify" function to make classification tables
		on an existing, trained Classifier (avoiding destructive
		validation in "crossvalidate")

	-	tore out and replaced save/load functionality from scratch
		to use Storable to a single file rather than dumping it to
		a set of MLDBM files (seems to have improved size/speed of 
		resulting saved files, too)

	-	new save/load subsystem also fixes bugs loading saved Classifier 
		objects (thanks to Brad Davis for finding this bug in the first place)

	-	added a very rudimentary procmail-based spam filter called
		"spamometer" in the examples directory
